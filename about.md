I am an Engineer at heart and an Architect at profession based in Sydney. 

I have been helping the organisations to transform their business and driven various business outcomes using technology since 2006. In my experience, everyday has been a new day for me, new challenges leading to new learnings. This is a blog that attempts to narrate the tales that an engineer would share with the rest from his work laptop.
